# GP-Test-2023

Here is a video of the sketch you will be making today:



You can use any of the following references during the test, but no other internet resources are permitted and no collaboration

- https://processing.org/reference/
- https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual.html

- Start with a blank Processing sketch
- Store your sketch on a public github repository and submit the link to the repo at the end of the test
- Make a class called Flag that draws a single flag to the screen as per the video. The class should have fields for for w and h (width and height of the flag) and everything in the flag should be drawn using LOOPS for full marks (apart from the circle). The class should have a *constructor* and *render* and *update* methods. The flag should scale based on w and h.
- Create an arraylist of 10 flag objects at different positions with different widths and heights
- The flags should move similar to the video and wrap when they go off the sceen
- I used sin waves to make the flags change their sizes

You dont have to get the colours to match the video exactly

Marking Scheme

| Task | Marks |
|------|-------|
| Making the class | 10 marks |
| Drawing the horizontal bars | 10 marks |
| Drawing the triangles | 20 marks |
| Creating and populating the arraylist | 10 marks |
| Moving the flag | 20 maraks |
| Changing the sizes of the flag | 20 marks |
| Use of git | 10 marks |

To get full marks you should use:

At least one class
At least one array
At least one arraylist
Loops
